Molecular biodiversity data in SBDI
===================================
The `Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (SBDI) <https://biodiversitydata.se/>`_ is developed in collaboration with the `Living Atlas Community <https://living-atlases.gbif.org/>`_, and aims to make different types of Swedish biodiversity data accessible for integrative analysis in a single platform. As part of this effort, we want to make it easier to publish, access and use molecular biodiversity data, i.e. sequence-based observations derived from metabarcoding or metagenomics studies of environmental samples.

We will provide services ranging from step-by-step guides to scripted pipelines, e.g. for `ENA submission of raw reads <ena-metabar.html>`_, or denoising of amplicon sequencing data. Currently available services are listed in the sidebar menu. We also present a technical/functional overview of our system for processing and handling of Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), now being developed at SBDI. 

Please email any suggestions or questions to `SBDI Molecular Data Support`_, or take our `online survey for metabarcoders <https://bit.ly/2MGxy4d>`_.
