# mol-data
Documentation for molecular data services provided by [Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure](https://biodiversitydata.se/)

*rdocs*: Source and build directories for [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). Edit content here. Then use `make github` command (as suggested by [jason-huling](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3382#issuecomment-470772316)) to build html, and copy files to *docs* directory.

*docs*: Build output (html) copied from rdocs. This dir is used to build our [mol-data GitHub Pages](https://biodiversitydata-se.github.io/mol-data/).
