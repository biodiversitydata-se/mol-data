[ All ],`broad-scale environmental context <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/envo/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FENVO_00000428>`_, "Report the major environmental system the sample or specimen came from. The system(s) identified should have a coarse spatial grain, to provide the general environmental context of where the sampling was done (e.g. in the desert or a rainforest). We recommend using subclasses of EnvO’s biome class: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000428. EnvO documentation about how to use the field: https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/wiki/Using-ENVO-with-MIxS."
[ All ],`local environmental context <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/envo/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FENVO_01000813>`_, "Report the entity or entities which are in the sample or specimen’s local vicinity and which you believe have significant causal influences on your sample or specimen. We recommend using EnvO terms which are of smaller spatial grain than your entry for 'broad-scale environmental context'. Terms, such as anatomical sites, from other OBO Library ontologies which interoperate with EnvO (e.g. UBERON) are accepted in this field. EnvO documentation about how to use the field: https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/wiki/Using-ENVO-with-MIxS."
[ All ],`environmental medium <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/envo/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FENVO_00010483>`_, "Report the environmental material(s) immediately surrounding the sample or specimen at the time of sampling. We recommend using subclasses of 'environmental material' (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00010483). EnvO documentation about how to use the field: https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/wiki/Using-ENVO-with-MIxS . Terms from other OBO ontologies are permissible as long as they reference mass/volume nouns (e.g. air, water, blood) and not discrete, countable entities (e.g. a tree, a leaf, a table top)."
[ All ],`sequencing method <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0400103>`_, "Sequencing machine used. Where possible the term should be taken from the OBI list of DNA sequencers (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0400103)."
