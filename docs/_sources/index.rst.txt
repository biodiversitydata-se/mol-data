Molecular biodiversity data in SBDI
===================================
The `Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (SBDI) <https://biodiversitydata.se/>`_ is developed in collaboration with the `Living Atlas Community <https://living-atlases.gbif.org/>`_, and aims to make Swedish biodiversity data accessible for integrative analysis in a single platform. As part of this effort, we want to make it easier to publish, access and use molecular biodiversity data, i.e. sequence-based observations derived from metabarcoding or metagenomics studies of environmental samples.

We provide a step-by-step `guide to ENA submission <ena-metabar.html>`_ of raw reads , and are currently collaborating on a scripted `pipeline for denoising and taxonomic annotation <https://nf-co.re/ampliseq>`_ of amplicon sequencing data, from both Illumina and PacBio platforms. For anyone interested in sharing or using ASV occurrence data, we are also developing a `molecular module <https://asv-portal.biodiversitydata.se>`_ to help integrate ASV occurrences into the `SBDI BioAtlas <https://tools.biodiversitydata.se//>`_.
