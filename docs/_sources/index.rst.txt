Molecular biodiversity data in BAS
==================================
As part of the `Biodiversity Atlas Sweden (BAS) <https://bioatlas.se/>`_ project, we aim to make it easier to publish, access and use molecular biodiversity data, i.e. sequence-based observations derived from metabarcoding or metagenomics studies of environmental samples. We will provide services ranging from step-by-step guides to scripted pipelines, e.g. for `ENA submission of raw reads <https://bioatlas.github.io/mol-data/ena-metabar.html>`_, or denoising of amplicon sequencing data. Available services are listed in the left-hand sidebar menu.

Please email any suggestions or questions to `BAS Molecular Data Support`_, or take our `online survey for metabarcoders <https://bit.ly/2MGxy4d>`_.
